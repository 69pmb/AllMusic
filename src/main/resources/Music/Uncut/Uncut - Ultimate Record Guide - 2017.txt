#How to buy all the greatest music of the last 60 years.
#This list was put together primarily for vinyl collectors or physics deniers as some people like to call them, to cater for the upsurge in the sport of collecting vinyl! In compiling a list specifically for vinyl must lead to many omissions. Which begs the question, Is this a ‘best of' list or just the best of what is available on vinyl? A get out section at the end of the magazine, lists many of the albums that are not, at the time of going to press, available on vinyl. This only opens up the argument even more. Example, in the “not on vinyl section” Bowie's ‘Never Let Me Down' is listed. Even Bowie had little time for this album. However, nowhere are ‘Earthling', ‘Hours' or ‘Black Tie White Noise' mentioned, albums that were generally considered superior.
#But hey, feel free to get the omissions on CD or download, especially if you object to paying up to 4 times the price for vinyl. (i.e. The Beatles Sgt. Pepper £10 on CD - £40 vinyl). You can't argue with stupid! Just to illustrate the point, here are a few I picked up from Fopp Bristol at the end of January 2018.
#I wonder if artists, when listening the first time to the playback in the studio to their just recorded masterpiece think, this will sound even better played on a £50 Crosley turntable with a bit of static, wow And flutter, turntable rumble, a few scratches And fluff on the needle! No, OK that's just me then.
#Having said that, this is still a pretty comprehensive listing. 1722 entrees, including most genres - rock, pop, jazz, soul, R'n'B, dance, blues, indie, folk, Americana, electronica, grime although suprisingly little reggae! There are enough obscure entrees to keep the most avid collector (including myself) busy for a few days at least!
#For anyone interseted I have 1127 of the albums listsed at the time of adding to the site at the end of 2017.
#The list is presented here in alphabetical order as opposed to date order in the original magazine. The entrees that appeared on the last page were the ones that were not available on vinyl at the time of publishing. I have identified these by adding “N/V” after the year.
