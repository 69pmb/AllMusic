#MOJO - (June 2007)
#â€œFrom Autobahn to Iron Maiden, theyâ€™re the 100 albums, singles & 78s that made us see the world differently, that made grown women to lose their minds & 13-year-old boys buy plywood guitars from the Littlewoods catalogue. The most influential & inspirational recordings ever made, they changed music - the way it was played, bought or even imaginedâ€?.
