#5-Star Albums From The Fourth Edition (2004)
#This fourth edition contains an impressive - 70% - amount of new material. Readers will find fresh updates to entries on established artists, hundreds of brand new entries on the people and recordings that epitomize the 90s and the sounds of the 21st century - from Beck to OutKast to the White Stripes And beyond... Published by Simon And Schuster, New York, 2004 Edited by Nathan Brackett (Senior Editor at Rolling Stone) And Christian Hoard (contributor to Rolling Stone And Village Voice).
#The Albums are usually entered here in the order they are listed in the book. Artists are often given sub-entries in the book: ie - Baader Meinhof and Black Box Recorder are listed under the Auteurs, but as none of these get 5 Stars, it doesn't affect this list! Label and year of release is only given here when absolutely necessary to identify an album, often in the case of self-titled albums, and Greatest Hits And Best Of compilations. As the book only lists albums available at the time of writing, previous 5-Star LPs are sometimes deleted and therefore now not in this list, this doesn't necessarily mean they've been down-rated. (ie Fairport Convention's Unhalfbricking received 5-Stars in the 3rd edition, but isn't in this list, it wasn't given a lower rating, just temporarily deleted).
