#Ultimate Music Collection
#(April 2005)

#For clarity in this listing, I've placed the Star Playlists (20 tracks handpicked by some of Q's fav stars) at the end, in the original article they were at random points. The same goes for Essential Artists (20 Essential Tracks & one album for a few select big names). Article had, usually, one 'Essential' album & 10 'Further Listening' albums (in no order of merit) for each genre and 50 'Tracks' (in alphabetical order). They're reprinted in the same format here, though the albums have been placed into alphabetical order by artist & the Essential album marked with a *. I've taken the liberty of correcting spelling mistakes, (ie: it's 'Baba O'Riley not Baba O'Reilly' by The Who), though probably made some of my own!
