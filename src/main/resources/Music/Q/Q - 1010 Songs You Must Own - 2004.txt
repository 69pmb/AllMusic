#(September 2004)
#What do you get if you put together: 200 tracks handpicked by the stars, 500 expertly selected by Q, 300 tunes to live your life by and the 10 best songs ever written? Answer: the ultimate music collection. Take it away, it's all yours...
#The order the lists appear here differ slightly from the magazine for clarity. All lists are alphabetical by song, unless indicated otherwise. I have tended to omit the word 'the' unless essential to understanding of song or band name. I have therefore altered alphabetical orders to incorporate this. The #Q50s were scattered throughout the feature, they're listed here at the beginning. The celebrity picks lists were generally in no order, so they're now alphabetical, with a * indicating the 'essential track' where it was listed as such.
